`Resource group`: logical construct that groups multiple resources together so they can be managed as single entity based on lifecycle and security. Resources that share a similar lifecycle may be created or deleted as a group. Each resource can only exist in one group. Resource group needs a location because a resource group stores metadata about the resources. When you specify a location, you're specifying where the metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you might need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region.
